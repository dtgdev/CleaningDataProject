The code works as follows:
 
 First, it merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 	Get the X training data and store it into a temporary file
 	Get the Y training data and store it into a temporary file
 	Get the subject training data and store it into a temporary file
 	Then merge all files using the rbind command. This should be a problem as all the files
 	are identical, the same number of columns with labels. 
 	
 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 	
 	Read the features file
 	get the row's indices of the mean and std from column 2
 	get the filtered data based on the mean and std from the X training data based
 	on the indices and convert to a lower case
 	
  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
 
   read activity_labels.txt file
   convert it as character 
   apply descriptive activity names: Then appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names
   
   Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
     loop by the number of subjects as an outer loop
     inner loop based on the number of activities
     And apply the average of each variable for each activity
     And apply the average of each variable for each subject
     then write the aggregated result to a file
